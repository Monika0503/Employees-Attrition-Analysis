# Employees-Attrition-Analysis
The main objectives for this project is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition. Development of retention strategies is important to the growth of a company. Employee turnover has many consequences such as low morale, increased recruitment costs, and decreased productivity. 


CONCLUSIONS:
1) At the first part of the project, we have made a cleaning . We have put our target variable into the centre and made an exploration of data around of it. In that part, we have had some conclusions about features. In the Initial Conclusions section, we have expressed our conclusions clearly. After building models, we have seen that many of conclusions are covering our feature importance results which are obtained from random forest algorithm.
2) Based on the results of the random forest analysis we can conclude that the top 5 features are: Average working hours, Age, Years at the company, Monthly Income and Total working Hours. Those features could be important for the manager in order to reduce the level of attrition among employees.
3) For this particular dataset, we conclude that the best model to use in order to predict attrition is random forest. We also modify our random forest model by reducing the number of trees needed to construct the forest from 500 (default) to 100 based on the
error rate for each tree without compromising our results.
4) The BORUTA PLOT clearly represents the factors which serve as the top reasons for attrition in a company: Average working hours, Age, Monthly Income ,Employment satisfaction and Percent salary hike.
5) Employees generally left when they are underworked / overworked(Average working hours)
6)
Employee satisfaction plays a major role for employee turnover.
7) In the stacked bar charts, we saw employees who left were:
• In human resources department
• Less monthly income
• Worked over time
• Had low job satisfaction
• Had low environment satisfaction
• Had bad work life balance
8)
Chi-square results revealed gender, education, stock option level and performance
rating did not have a significant role in employee attrition. Similarly, ANOVA test revealed
that Distance From Home also doesn’t have a significant role in employee attrition.
